# What Is a Shell?

The shell's job, then, is to translate the user's command lines into operating system instructions. 
For example, consider this command line:

```
sort -n phonelist > phonelist.sorted
```

This means, "Sort lines in the file _phonelist_ in numerical order, 
and put the result in the file "phonelist.sorted"

Here's what the shell does with this command:

1. Breaks up the line into the pieces _sort_ , _-n_ , _phonelist_ , _>_ , and _phonelist.sorted_. These pieces are called words.
2. Determines the purpose of the words: _sort_ is a command, _-n_ and _phonelist_ are arguments, and _>_ and _phonelist.sorted_ , taken together, are I/O instructions.
3. Sets up the I/O according to **>** phonelist.sorted (output to the file phone list.sorted) and some standard, implicit instructions.
4. Finds the command sort in a file and runs it with the option **-n** (numerical order) and the argument phonelist (input filename).


Of course, each of these steps really involves several substeps, each of which includes a particular instruction
to the underlying operating system.

Remember that the shell itself is not UNIXâ€”just the user interface to it. UNIX is one of the first operating systems to make the user interface independent of the operating system.
